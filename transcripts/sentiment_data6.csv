7,Have I caught you at a good time?,1.788,B,NEUTRAL
8,"For now, it's fine, but I might be busy soon, but we can talk about it now.",4.504,A,POSITIVE
9,Perfect.,0.6,B,POSITIVE
10,"First, I'd like to quickly confirm your address and see if it's part of our serviceable locations.",4.56,B,NEUTRAL
11,"What we have here is key spruce Way, San Antonio, Florida 33576.",7.654,B,NEUTRAL
12,Is this correct?,1.204,B,NEUTRAL
13,That's correct.,1.18,A,NEUTRAL
14,Perfect.,0.616,B,POSITIVE
15,So this address is eligible for a fiber connection.,2.664,B,NEUTRAL
16,We can provide you with the service.,1.824,B,NEUTRAL
17,Would you like to know more about our available plans?,2.78,B,NEUTRAL
18,"Actually, I was just curious if my location's serviceable for fiber, but I'm not really actively looking to switch right now.",7.508,A,NEUTRAL
19,"I'm kind of happy with my current provider, so I understand this is just going to be a discovery call to see if there are areas where we might be able to help you out with.",9.172,B,POSITIVE
20,"If I could just ask you real quick, how much is the average speed you're getting from your current provider?",4.652,B,NEUTRAL
21,I'm not sure.,0.792,A,NEUTRAL
22,I haven't really checked.,1.408,A,NEUTRAL
23,And what's your current provider?,1.708,B,NEUTRAL
24,BCNC.,1.224,A,NEUTRAL
25,And what do you usually use your connection for?,2.288,B,NEUTRAL
26,"Browsing, gaming, streaming, um, all sorts of things, but mainly just browsing, facetime, and streaming most of all.",9.62,A,NEUTRAL
27,"And are you totally happy with how the speed performs for each of these activities, or do you think it could be better in some aspects?",6.184,B,NEUTRAL
28,"Uh, I would say totally happy, but mostly it's acceptable.",5.024,A,POSITIVE
29,"When watching videos on 4k, there's definitely some lagging.",2.92,A,NEGATIVE
30,Doesn't matter which device.,0.96,A,NEUTRAL
31,"On our phones, on our tv, it would just freeze for a few seconds and then resume.",4.162,A,NEUTRAL
32,I'm guessing it's a connection because it's definitely not the device.,2.778,A,NEUTRAL
33,We just bought this 4K tv last month and it's been happening like clockwork every time we watch in 4k.,5.02,A,NEUTRAL
34,"Other than that, it's fine.",1.82,A,POSITIVE
35,"You know, when streaming 4k videos, you normally need 25 megabits per second to effectively load without lagging anything lower than 25.",7.408,B,NEUTRAL
36,It would definitely slow you down one way or another.,2.676,B,NEGATIVE
37,"Oh, really?",0.544,A,NEUTRAL
38,I wasn't exactly aware of that.,2.068,A,NEUTRAL
39,"Tell you what, Vanessa, why don't we test your connection and see how much speed you're exactly getting?",4.824,B,NEUTRAL
40,Because I think you're getting less than 25.,2.152,B,NEUTRAL
41,"Or if you are, chances are it's not a consistent 25 throughout the day.",3.792,B,NEGATIVE
42,Are you in front of your computer right now?,1.908,B,NEUTRAL
43,"No, but now that you raise that I'm actually curious since I haven't really checked the speed before.",4.552,A,NEUTRAL
44,Huh.,0.448,A,NEUTRAL
45,Uh.,0.736,A,NEUTRAL
46,"All right, let's just go to my computer.",1.776,A,NEUTRAL
47,What do you want me to do?,1.26,A,NEUTRAL
48,So if you could just open a browser and go to speedtest.net.,4.02,B,NEUTRAL
49,Uh huh.,0.928,B,NEUTRAL
50,Speedtest.net.,3.032,A,NEUTRAL
51,Okay.,1.052,A,NEUTRAL
52,And then click go once you're there.,2.0,B,NEUTRAL
53,Okay.,0.86,A,NEUTRAL
54,"It says, oh, wow, this thing's moving.",3.14,A,POSITIVE
55,"Yep, that's the meter.",1.552,B,NEUTRAL
56,The first number should be your download speed.,2.604,B,NEUTRAL
57,Okay.,0.408,B,NEUTRAL
58,It says 8.19.,1.592,A,NEUTRAL
59,And there's another wheel coming up.,1.92,A,NEUTRAL
60,I guess that'll be the upload speed.,1.944,A,NEUTRAL
61,"Yep, that'll be the upload speed.",2.12,B,NEUTRAL
62,Huh.,0.368,B,NEUTRAL
63,So now it says 17.43.,3.128,A,NEUTRAL
64,So 9.19 and 17.43.,3.05,A,NEUTRAL
65,"So definitely not enough, huh?",1.838,A,NEGATIVE
66,"No, definitely not enough to load 4k, you know, when you're streaming videos, we need to look at your download speed, how much megabits you're downloading from the web per second.",8.92,B,NEGATIVE
67,Okay.,0.448,A,NEUTRAL
68,Your download speed is 8.19.,1.584,B,NEUTRAL
69,"That's good enough for 1080, but definitely not for 4k.",3.056,B,NEUTRAL
70,"Because, you see, 4k technically is four times the size of 1080.",4.04,B,NEUTRAL
71,So that's like 2 million pixels versus 8 million pixels per second.,4.42,B,NEUTRAL
72,"Oh, wow.",0.736,A,POSITIVE
73,So that explains the lagging then.,1.954,A,NEUTRAL
74,"Oh, definitely.",0.942,B,POSITIVE
75,There's no doubt about it.,1.528,B,NEUTRAL
76,"And that's what I'm calling you about today, Vanessa.",2.136,B,NEUTRAL
77,"If you want to make the most out of your 4K tv, then have something much faster for you with an attractive pricing.",6.56,B,POSITIVE
78,Okay.,0.912,A,NEUTRAL
79,"You could get up to 800 megabits per second, which is roughly 100 times faster than your current download speed.",7.152,B,POSITIVE
80,Would you like to know more about the available plans?,2.56,B,NEUTRAL
81,"Well, that sounds great, but how much is it?",2.744,A,POSITIVE
82,"It depends on the plan, but 800 megabits per second starts as low as $50 per month plus installation fees.",7.444,B,NEUTRAL
83,Okay.,0.98,A,NEUTRAL
84,I don't know.,0.68,A,NEUTRAL
85,That's kind of too much for me.,1.48,A,NEGATIVE
86,I don't think we're willing to pay that much.,2.056,A,NEGATIVE
87,"Our Internet is a little slow, but it works for us most of the time, so I don't think so.",5.812,A,NEUTRAL
88,Okay.,0.592,B,NEUTRAL
89,How much do you pay monthly for your current connection?,2.164,B,NEUTRAL
90,"About 30, $33, something like that.",3.376,A,NEUTRAL
91,That's kind of like my price range.,1.536,A,NEUTRAL
92,I don't think I want to be paying any higher than that.,2.248,A,NEGATIVE
93,Okay.,0.44,B,NEUTRAL
94,"Okay, I get you.",1.064,B,NEUTRAL
95,Let me check here.,0.704,B,NEUTRAL

98,"Oh, okay.",1.18,A,NEUTRAL
99,Okay.,0.624,B,NEUTRAL
100,What if I tell you you can get 100 megabits per second for only $25 with free installation fee?,7.284,B,NEUTRAL
101,$25 for how much?,1.668,A,NEUTRAL
102,How much speed?,1.096,A,NEUTRAL
103,100 megabits.,1.432,B,NEUTRAL
104,"Not as fast as 800, but definitely twelve times faster than your current download speed, more than enough to play four k and cheaper than $33.",8.304,B,POSITIVE
105,How does that sound?,1.252,B,NEUTRAL
106,That's getting interesting.,1.58,A,POSITIVE
107,But first I'm gonna have to talk to my husband about it.,2.74,A,NEUTRAL
108,I also have to go to work now.,1.84,A,NEUTRAL
109,Can you call me later after work this evening?,3.018,A,NEUTRAL

132,I'm a little unclear about the pricing.,1.808,A,NEGATIVE
133,"You said it was dollar 25, which is a lot cheaper than my current provider and a lot faster too, which is what got us interested, you know?",8.776,A,POSITIVE
134,Sure.,0.592,A,NEUTRAL
135,"But what I'd like to know is $25 going to be my regular monthly fee or is it only for a couple of months and I'll pay the regular price because if that is the case, we're not interested.",12.004,A,NEGATIVE
136,"Oh, $25 is actually already our regular pricing for 100 megabits per second fiber connection.",5.62,B,NEUTRAL
137,"Oh, and no additional fee on top of dollar 25 after a few months, no additional fee because that's already the regular pricing and the installation is free as well.",10.02,B,NEUTRAL
138,"Oh, okay then.",1.752,A,NEUTRAL
139,Great.,0.408,A,POSITIVE
140,Let's do it.,0.944,A,POSITIVE
